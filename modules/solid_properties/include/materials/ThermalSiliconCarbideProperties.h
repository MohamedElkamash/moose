   * Thermal conductivity (W/m$\cdot$K) as a function of temperature (K).
   * The thermal conductivity of silicon carbide depends strongly on
   * the grain size, the nature of the grain boundaries,
   * and the presence of additives such as those included in sintering. For
   * monolithic silicon carbide, it is recommended to use single crystal or
   * chemical vapor deposition (CVD) properties (though even within CVD grades
   * there can be significant variation) \cite snead. For this reason,
   * manufacturer-specific information should be preferred to the correlations
   * available in this user object.
   *
   * Two correlations are available for use here - the correlation in \cite snead
   * pertaining to CVD silicon carbide, and a second correlation giving values
   * much closer to those typically used for modeling the silicon carbide in
   * TRISO fuels \cite parfume. At 650 $\degree$ C, the Snead correlation predicts
   * a thermal conductivity of about 106 W/m$\cdot$K, while the PARFUME correlation
   * predicts a value much closer to the constant values of 30 W/m$\cdot$K and
   * 16 W/m$\cdot$K used elsewhere \cite xin_wang_thesis \cite stainsby.
   *
   * A thermal diffusivity of $2.3e-4 \pm 1.1e-4$ m$^2$/s is measured by Rochais et. al
   * at room temperature \cite rochais. Assuming a density of 3216.0 kg/m$^3$ and a
   * specific heat of 676.7 J/kg$\cdot$K given by the other correlations in this
   * user object, Rochais et. al predict a thermal conductivity in the range of
   * 261 to 740 W/m$\cdot$K. At room temperature, Lopez-Honorato et. al predict
   * a thermal conductivity of 168 W/m$\cdot$K \cite lopez_honorato.
   * The Snead correlation prediction is closest to these values
   * at room temperature, while the PARFUME correlation is much lower. However, others
   * have measured 16.74, 50, and 62 W/m$\cdot$K \cite lopez_honorato, values
   * that are much closer to the PARFUME correlation predictions.
