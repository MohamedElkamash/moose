/**
 * Graphite thermal properties as a function of temperature appropriate for
 * graphite moderator and reflectors \cite baker. This form of graphite is
 * formed by baking carbon at high temperature, and has different properties
 * from graphite formed by chemical vapor deposition such as pyrolitic carbon.
 *
 * The thermal properties of graphite are strongly dependent on the raw materials,
 * manufacturing process, and oxidation state, so manufacturer-specific properties,
 * if available, are preferred to the use of this user object.
 *
 * At atmospheric pressure, sublimation begins at approximately 3800 K, while
 * the lowest pressure at which melting is possible is at 103 atm and 4250 K.
 * Sublimation at reactor temperatures is possible only when the pressure
 * is many orders of magnitude lower than atmospheric, and hence these properties
 * correspond only to solid graphite.

   *
   * Due to the hexagonal lattice structure typical of
   * most graphites, the thermal conductivity is about two orders of magnitude
   * higher in the planar direction than in the perpendicular direction.
   * Measurements of thermal conductivity for three different grades of nuclear
   * graphite produced by GrafTech International Holdings Inc. (PCEA, PCIB-SFG,
   * and PPEA) in the range of 25 to 900 $\degreeC$ show a difference of between
   * 15 and 25 W/m$\cdot$K between the three grades \cite albers. Experimental data is
   * provided by McEligot et. al for isotropic G-348 graphite for
   * 25 $\degree$ C $\le$ T $\le$ 1000 $\degree$ C in the form of a parabolic
   * correlation; this data is re-fit with a
   * power correlation to permit (cautionary) extrapolation to
   * higher temperatures without giving non-physical increases in thermal
   * conductivity at the local minima of the parabolic fit \cite mceligot. The
   * R$^2$ value of this fit is 0.97620. The systematic uncertainty is $\pm$2.7% while
   * the random uncertainty is $\pm$1.5%. At low temperatures, this correlation
   * slightly underpredicts the GrafTech data \cite albers.
